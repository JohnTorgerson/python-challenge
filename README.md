### Diana Won in a Landslide!!

## Team
* Andrew Sundquist suggested I print using an f-string, which was very helpful.

* TA Colin worked with Nhan Tran debugging Change column solutions in PyBank and I sat in on that, however I couldn't get my formula for reading the change over two consecutive values to iterate properly. I know exacly what it needed to do, I just couldn't get the right syntax for it work.

* inspectorG4dget in Stack Overflow had a solution for printing to text files regarding delimiter values as None, but it didn't work here.
